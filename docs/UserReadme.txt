Archipelago Tyrian v0.99.0

== Setup =======================================================================

After downloading APTyrian, you will need to download the data files for Tyrian
and extract them to a subfolder called "data". Tyrian 2.1 data files will only
work for seeds with "enable_tyrian_2000_support" turned OFF, whereas Tyrian 2000
data files will work for all seeds.

== Important Notes =============================================================

Connecting to an Archipelago server can be done through the in-game menus, or
alternatively through the command line with the following option:
  --connect="<slot_name>@archipelago.gg:<port_number>"

If you have a single player .aptyrian file, drag and drop it over the game
window while in the "Select Game Mode" menu to start playing it. The option
within that menu to play a local game will eventually open a file dialog, but
that has yet to be implemented.

Progress is automatically saved after exiting a level or on quitting the game.

The following things are planned but not yet implemented:
- "Chaos" Twiddles (full randomizer, instead of giving random vanilla twiddles)
- "Ship Specs" display screen (showing received item progress and other info)

== Keyboard Controls ===========================================================

alt+enter      -- toggle full-screen
escape         -- open in-game menu
p              -- pause

arrow keys     -- ship movement
space          -- fire weapons
